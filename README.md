## Profile
I am a technical oriented Integration Specialist from Helsinki. I really like working on diverse projects, with different technologies, systems and people. Also I like to constantly develop myself and learn new things, both hard and soft skills. Besides my experience in integrations, I have worked as a game developer and an Automation Mechanic in the past.

In my leisure time, I usually spend time with my kids or consume fictional entertainment.
Walking in nature is also close to my heart.
