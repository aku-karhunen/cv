## Profile
I am a technical oriented Integration Specialist from Helsinki. Besides my experience in
integrations, I have worked as a game developer and an Automation Mechanic in the
past.

In my leisure time, I usually spend time with my kids or consume fictional entertainment.
Walking in nature is also close to my heart.
